### Reboot Sequence: Initiated

When systems crash — human or machine — the fix isn't always in the command line.  
Sometimes it’s in the silence between keystrokes.

I used to think clarity came from control, but it really comes from knowing when to **reboot**.  
The same logic I use to repair machines is the one I use to repair myself:  
check logs, find errors, patch habits, and restart.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove negativity
sudo systemctl enable focus
