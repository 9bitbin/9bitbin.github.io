Sometimes I treat my thoughts like a misconfigured shell.

A few commands here, a few resets there â€” and eventually things compile again.  
Debugging code has taught me that the same patience needed to fix a program applies to untangling the self.

Each error message is just a prompt for reflection.  
Run the script, read the logs, and keep iterating.
