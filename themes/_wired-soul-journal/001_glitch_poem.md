Glitches are art.  
Every pixel, every error, every frame skip —  
a trace of being human in the system.

Maybe the soul was never meant to run bug-free.

01000111 01101100 01101001 01110100 01100011 01101000
Between pixels and pulse, I exist.
Static hums like memory — imperfect, human.
Every bug is a heartbeat.
Every frame, a confession.

Sometimes the most meaningful art happens when systems *fail beautifully.*
