The Fi–Te axis is a quiet war between authenticity and efficiency.

When I try to live purely by logic, I lose warmth.  
When I follow only feeling, I lose structure.  
Balance isn’t compromise — it’s harmony.  

Every decision becomes a small meditation on how to align inner truth with outer action.
