A short walk can reboot the entire system.

I used to underestimate how physical movement clears mental clutter.  
Now I see each step as a micro-commit — a way to push calmness into my working branch of life.

10 minutes, no headphones, just breath and gravity.  
That’s my human version of `ctrl + alt + delete`.
