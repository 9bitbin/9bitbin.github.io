A short walk can reboot the entire system.

I used to underestimate how physical movement clears mental clutter.  
Now I see each step as a micro-commit — a way to push calmness into my working branch of life.

10 minutes, no headphones, just breath and gravity.  
That’s my human version of `ctrl + alt + delete`.

### Debugging the Mind, One Step at a Time

Every evening, I walk.  
Not to reach anywhere — just to breathe.  
It’s my manual garbage collection.

Steps become thoughts, thoughts become clarity.  
I’ve realized motion restores function — both physically and mentally.

You don’t always need productivity apps to reset your life.  
Sometimes the system fix is just **walking until you remember who you are**.
