### Where People Meet Progress

I’ve seen how technology can divide or connect — it depends on who writes the code.  
When I joined local community projects through the Urban League,  
I realized tech isn’t just hardware or code — it’s **infrastructure for belonging**.

Bridging civic life and digital design means listening before building.  
You can’t automate empathy, but you can **engineer accessibility**.

That’s what I call “Tech & Tranquility” — where systems serve people, not the other way around.
