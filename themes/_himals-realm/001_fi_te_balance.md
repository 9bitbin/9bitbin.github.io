The Fi–Te axis is a quiet war between authenticity and efficiency.

When I try to live purely by logic, I lose warmth.  
When I follow only feeling, I lose structure.  
Balance isn’t compromise — it’s harmony.  

Every decision becomes a small meditation on how to align inner truth with outer action.

An inner compass guided by values often collides with the external world of logic and structure.  
Here’s how I’ve been learning to balance both — without losing authenticity.
