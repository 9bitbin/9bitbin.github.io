    <h2>Hi, I’m Himal Shrestha 👋</h2>

    <p>
      I’m an <strong>IT professional</strong>, <strong>problem-solver</strong>, and <strong>writer</strong> based in New York — 
      passionate about connecting technology with the human experience.
      <br><br>
      I’ve always believed that code and creativity share the same language — both are systems that reflect how we think,
      grow, and build meaning. Over time, my work in IT, writing, and digital design has evolved into something more holistic:
      a balance between <em>clarity and creativity</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Rotating Soul</strong> is my ongoing project — part journal, part workshop.  
      Every section of this site explores a different side of my life:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>🧰 <strong>Mind over Machine</strong> — my experiments in IT, automation, and tech tutorials</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Himal’s Realm</strong> — reflections on psychology, philosophy, and the quiet mind</li>
      <li>🌿 <strong>The Reflective Engineer</strong> — systems for growth, health, and discipline</li>
      <li>💬 <strong>Tech & Tranquility</strong> — community, connection, and how people shape progress</li>
      <li>🎨 <strong>Wired Soul Journal</strong> — art, lyrics, and digital emotion in motion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Beyond work, I’m curious about how technology can heal instead of hurry — 
      how creativity can coexist with structure — 
      and how small systems, both human and digital, can make life more peaceful.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this sounds like your wavelength, feel free to explore the blog or reach out — 
      everything here is built with a mix of curiosity, caffeine, and care.
